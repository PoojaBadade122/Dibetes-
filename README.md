# Diabetes Prediction Project

## **Project Overview**

This project predicts the likelihood of a person having diabetes based on various health parameters. It uses **machine learning algorithms** to analyze patterns in the dataset and provide predictions with high accuracy.

## **Objective**

The main objective of this project is to:

* Identify individuals at risk of diabetes early.
* Provide a reliable prediction system for health monitoring.
* Demonstrate practical use of machine learning in healthcare.

## **Dataset**

* The dataset used is the **Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset** (commonly used for diabetes prediction).
* Features include:

  * Number of pregnancies
  * Glucose level
  * Blood pressure
  * Skin thickness
  * Insulin
  * BMI (Body Mass Index)
  * Diabetes pedigree function
  * Age
* Target variable: `Outcome` (0 = Non-diabetic, 1 = Diabetic)

## **Tools & Technologies**

* Python
* Jupyter Notebook
* Pandas, NumPy
* Scikit-learn (for ML models)
* Matplotlib & Seaborn (for data visualization)

## **Machine Learning Model**

* Models used: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree (or whichever you used)
* The dataset is split into **training and testing sets** to evaluate the model.
* Accuracy achieved: **[Insert your model accuracy]%**

## **How to Use**

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install required libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the notebook to explore the dataset, train the model, and test predictions.
4. Input your health data to get a diabetes prediction.
